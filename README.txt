# Battleship
Final summative project

# PLANS
Note - All planning is subject to changes.

Positions of units will be stored in a list of squares, much like a standard game of Battleship, formatted as such:
[[00,10,20,30,40,50 ...]
 [01,11,21,31,41,51 ...]
 [02,12,22,32,42,52 ...]
 ...]
 and so on until the dimensions of the board are reached.
 The values (currently coordinates) will contain the object occupying that square.
